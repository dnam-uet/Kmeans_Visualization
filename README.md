# Kmeans_Visualization
I create my own Kmeans algorithms and compare with KMeans (sklearn.cluster) algorithm. This is a pet project with Kmeans Algorithms using Pygame for UI, and sklearn.cluster (KMeans) for Algorithms button.


First of all, you need to install python and pygame on your local computer.

This is main screen

Step 1: You need to click on white board some point like this

![step1](https://github.com/dnam-uet/Kmeans_Visualization/blob/master/img/step1.PNG)

Step 2: You need to click + button or - button for K parameter

![step2](https://github.com/dnam-uet/Kmeans_Visualization/blob/master/img/step2.PNG)

Step 3: You need to click random button for random K cluster

![step3](https://github.com/dnam-uet/Kmeans_Visualization/blob/master/img/step3.PNG)

Step 4: And run button, you can see error (sum of distance point to cluster it's label)

![step4](https://github.com/dnam-uet/Kmeans_Visualization/blob/master/img/step4.PNG)

Step 5: Run again, you can see decreasing error

![step5](https://github.com/dnam-uet/Kmeans_Visualization/blob/master/img/step5.PNG)

You can click algorithm to run Kmeans algorithm from KMeans.
